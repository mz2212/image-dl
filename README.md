# Archived repo

This was intended to be a project to download image from various sites, kinda like [youtube-dl](https://youtube-dl.org) but then I discovered [imgbrd-grabber](https://bionus.github.io/imgbrd-grabber/) and opted to stop developing it. The dependancies used in this project have some vulnerabilities, thus the archival.

The vulnerabilities are found in the crates that do the network communication, so using this may leave your computer insecure. Please use [imgbrd-grabber](https://bionus.github.io/imgbrd-grabber/) instead as it is kept up to date.
